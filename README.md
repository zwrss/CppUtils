CppUtils
========

Let me present Cpp Utils

This was originally a part of my Academic project, but I decided to keep it and improve it. I'll try to add more utils in my spare time. I'm still learnig Cpp, so I'll improve the existing code over time.
This is not a best possible implementation - if you're looking for it, then look somewhere else :)

Comment/fork/request a pull if you want to - any help or tips are welcome :)

Current utils:

    List interface
    ArrayList implementation
    Optional implementation (no nulls anymore!)
